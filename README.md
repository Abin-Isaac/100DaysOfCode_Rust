# 100 Days Of Code in Rust

## First day 
We are using a main function here, seems like every rust program has this Referee here 

Remember, println is macro and ! is required to invoke it.

After this interacton it seems like entering naughty student caged in strict Teachers class. Cursor brackets shows the cage {cage or performance ?}

If you are pythonista please remember println doesn't know 2+2 so you need to provide needed string formatting Okay!!

## Second day 

Lets dive into 3 easy peasy comments of rust..probably you may be knowning them 

Single line comments should start with  //

Multi line comments should start with  /* and end with */

Doc comment should start and end with ///

Thats it..
