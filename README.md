# First day from 100 Days Of Code in Rust

First day 
We are using a main function here, seems like every rust program has this Referee here 
Remember, println is macro and ! is required to invoke it.
After this interacton it seems like entering naughty student caged in strict Teachers class. Cursor brackets shows the cage {cage or performance ?}

If you are pythonista please remember println doesn't know 2+2 so you need to provide needed string formatting Okay!!
